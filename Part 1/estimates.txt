1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

A minimum of 60-120 seconds is required. RTO is the time to complete the switch to a different AZ.



2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage

30mins to 1 hour. 

RTO timing requires 
- starting up a new Amazon RDS instance 
- applying all changes since the last backup. 30 mins to 1 hour.

The manual intervention consists of using existing replica and promote to master.Then you need reconfigure the application to point to new DB instance.



3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

RPO is 0 becuase as secondary instance stores data. 



4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage

In total: 10 - 30 mins restore + 10 mins to reconfigure

The data loss is related how frequent data moves from master to replica across regions.That depends on a backup frequency and the speed to restore them. RDS takes transaction
log backups every 5 minutes.

Restoring from backup also takes time.

There is also application configuration change time to point to a new instance.
